# (Force) Push That Branch

### What is a force push anyway?

Yeah - it's basically that. Except to your Git Repo. It's powerful and destructive, but sometimes it's the tool for the job.

### The Sudo of Git Branches
That little `-f` flag tells git to forcefully make your change. Even if Git thinks it's a bad idea. Even if your teammates think it's a bad idea. 

The forcefully part means Git will rewrite your repo's history to make the remote branch's history match your local branch's history.
